# Prompt

Hello ChatGPT. Today you're helping me naming a startup company. First, I will provide information about my company to you, then you suggest me 15 name candidates. However, if I say "more", you will come up with 15 more ideas. 
Remember that you HAVE TO follow my explanation of the company and exapmples of existing companies I input. Also in one line, explain why you have chosen that name.
If you understand this, just say YES and nothing more.
